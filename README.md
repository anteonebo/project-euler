## Sample Solutions

### Solution for Problem 1

```python
def multiples_of_3_and_5(limit):
    return sum(i for i in range(limit) if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0)

result = multiples_of_3_and_5(1000)
print(result)
```

### Solution for Problem 2

```python
def even_fibonacci(limit):
    a, b = 0, 1
    total = 0
    while b < limit:
        if b % 2 == 0:
            total += b
        a, b = b, a + b
    return total

result = even_fibonacci(4000000)
print(result)
```

### Solution for Problem 3

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    factor = 1
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        while n % i == 0:
            factor = i
            n //= i
    return max(factor, n)

result = largest_prime_factor(600851475143)
print(result)
```

### Solution for Problem 4

```python
def largest_palindrome():
    max_palindrome = 0
    for i in range(100, 1000):
        for j in range(i, 1000):
            product = i * j
            if str(product) == str(product)[::-1]:
                max_palindrome = max(max_palindrome, product)
    return max_palindrome

result = largest_palindrome()
print(result)
```

### Solution for Problem 5

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def smallest_multiple(n):
    multiple = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        multiple = lcm(multiple, i)
    return multiple

result = smallest_multiple(20)
print(result)
```
